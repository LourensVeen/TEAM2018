Enlighten Your ReseArch (EYRA) Benchmark Platform (NLeSC-Surf Alliance project 2018)

Abstract:
Manual analysis of research data is often tedious and expensive, and with the advent of big data close to impossible. However, algorithms that automatically analyse data are not readily available to researchers who are not computer science experts. Furthermore, not all algorithms perform equally well on all types of data. Getting insight into algorithm performance with respect to specific research questions is essential, especially since using suboptimal algorithms could have huge consequences and even lead to false research findings. Benchmarks provide a way to quantify algorithm performance with respect to a research question. Although many researchers are enthusiastic about benchmarking their research in an open, collaborative platform that uses data, truth criteria and metrics, there is currently no platform to easily set up a research benchmark. In this alliance, SURF and the eScience Center join forces to develop a platform that provides both a software and hardware infrastructure for research benchmarks. For the proposed pilot platform we will collaborate with researchers from the four discipline areas as defined by the eScience Center (Environment & Sustainability, Humanities & Social Sciences, Life Sciences & eHealth, Physics & Beyond). By default, the benchmarking  platform will adhere to the FAIR principles with respect to data, ground truth, metrics, algorithms and benchmarks in general, and promote interdisciplinary collaboration and cross-fertilization. It provides researchers from all scientific disciplines with the tools and infrastructure to easily set-up an open benchmark to identify the best performing algorithm for their specific research problem, and computer scientists with an environment to test their algorithms on a wide variety of relevant applications.
