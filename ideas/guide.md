# Description

[The guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/) is an important point of contact between us and the outside world. People are starting to look at it more and more, and it is likely to continue to grow in importance. As such, it would be useful to spend some effort making sure the guide is as useful and up-to-date as possible.

# Goals

 - Look at the guide with critical eyes:
   - Add content which is missing
   - Update content which is outdated
   - Move content which is not relevant to an *internal* guide.
   - Remove content which is no longer relevant
